<p>
  My name is Marcin Drozd and I am a self-taught developer.
  That's right, I woke up one day and decided that it's the high time to fulfill my long time dream.
</p>

<p>
  I've been learning new things ever since. Actually, learning new things was the main reason I chose
  this path. Developers should never stop learning. On this blog, I share my struggles, things I've discovered
  or how simply what I read recently. I hope that it might be helpful, especially for those who as me are
  interested in this huge, sometimes scary world of programming.
</p>

<p>
  I'm mostly writing Ruby on Rails apps, but I am also interested in JS (React) and Elixir.
